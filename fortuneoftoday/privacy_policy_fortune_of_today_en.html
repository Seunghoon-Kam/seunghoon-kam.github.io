    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: November 16, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This privacy policy explains how the mobile application <strong>Fortune of Today</strong> (the “App”)
      collects, uses, and protects your information.
    </p>

    <p>
      The App is developed and operated by <strong>Seunghoon Kam</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <p>
      The App may allow you to enter basic profile information such as name, gender, and date of birth
      in order to generate fortune results. This information is stored only on your device and is not
      transmitted to our servers.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically collected information</h3>
    <p>
      The App itself does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, or
      phone number. However, we may use third-party services that collect information automatically, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advertising networks (for example, Google AdMob)</li>
      <li>Crash reporting or analytics services (if enabled in future updates)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These third parties may collect device identifiers, advertising IDs, IP addresses, app usage data,
      and other diagnostic information in accordance with their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information described above for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, personalize, and improve the App’s features and content</li>
      <li>To display advertisements (including personalized ads, where allowed)</li>
      <li>To understand app performance and fix bugs or crashes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Advertising and In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      The App displays banner advertisements that may be provided by third-party ad networks such as Google AdMob.
      These networks may use cookies or advertising identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App also offers a non-consumable in-app purchase that permanently removes banner ads.
      When you complete a purchase, the platform (Apple) provides us with a purchase receipt so that
      we can verify and apply the “Remove Ads” feature. We do not receive your full payment information
      such as credit card numbers.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      User profile information that you enter in the App (such as name and birth date) is stored locally
      on your device. You can delete this information at any time by removing or reinstalling the App,
      or by using any in-app reset or delete options if provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data collected by third-party services (such as ad networks or analytics providers) is retained
      according to their own policies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed specifically at children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian
      and believe that your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so that we can
      take appropriate steps. We recommend that parents and guardians supervise their children’s use of
      mobile applications and review the privacy settings of their devices.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may share non-personally identifiable information
      with third-party service providers, such as advertising networks or analytics providers, solely for the
      purposes described in this policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also disclose information if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect our
      rights, property, or safety and that of our users.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information processed by the App.
      However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can disable personalized ads or reset your device’s advertising identifier in the privacy
        or advertising settings of your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can remove locally stored data by deleting or reinstalling the App, or by using in-app reset
        functions if available.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may choose to purchase the in-app “Remove Ads” option to stop banner ads from being displayed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date
      at the top of this page. Significant changes may also be announced in the App. We recommend that you review
      this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
    </p>
