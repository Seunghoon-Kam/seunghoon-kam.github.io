    <p class="updated">Last Updated: 2025-01-01</p>

    <p>
        SimpleURL ("the App") is developed and operated by <strong>Seunghoon Kam</strong>
        ("we", "us", or "our"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
        This Privacy Policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your rights.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>The App <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong></p>
        <p>We do NOT collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name, email address, phone number</li>
            <li>Location data</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Data Used by the App</h2>

        <h3>(1) URL Processing & Local Content</h3>
        <p>
            The App processes URLs that you enter to create shortened URLs or manage URL lists.
            All URL processing is done <strong>locally on your device</strong> or through third-party URL shortening services.
            We do not store or log the URLs you enter.
        </p>

        <h3>(2) User Input & Local Saved Data</h3>
        <p>
            If you save URLs, create URL lists, or customize settings, this data is stored only on your device
            using Apple's local storage system (UserDefaults).
            We cannot access or retrieve this data.
        </p>

        <h3>(3) Push Notifications (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
            If you enable notifications, the App uses the device's local notification system to send reminders.
            Notification data is processed <strong>locally on your device</strong> and is not sent to any server.
        </p>

        <h3>(4) Advertising (AdMob)</h3>
        <p>
            The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display banner ads.
            Google may collect device identifiers, ad interaction data, and approximate location information.
            This data is handled solely by Google and is not accessible to us.
        </p>
        <p>For more information, please review Google's policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/" target="_blank">AdMob Policy Overview</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>(5) In-App Purchase: Remove Ads (If Available)</h3>
        <p>
            The App may offer an optional one-time purchase to remove ads.
            Purchases are processed securely through Apple's App Store.
            We do not receive or store any payment information.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App includes Google AdMob for advertising. Additionally, the App may use third-party URL shortening services
            to process URLs. These services may have their own privacy policies regarding URL processing.
            We do not share any information with third parties beyond what is processed by Google and URL shortening services.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since no personal information is collected or stored, no personal data is transmitted or saved on servers.
            All data, including your URLs and saved lists, remains on your device.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Because the App does not collect personal information, users do not need to request data deletion or modification.
            Deleting the App removes all local data stored on the device, including saved URLs and settings.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
